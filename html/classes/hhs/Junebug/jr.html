        <p>The Kansas City Chiefs drafted the star safety in college football from Tennessee Vols,Eric Berry,in 2010 draft.Berry was a star then and now.In his first season, Berry started all 16 games and became the first Chiefs rookie to be selected to the Pro Bowl since linebacker great Derrick Thomas.Berry had a big impact on the team's defense, helping to improve it from 29th best unit in 2009 in terms of points allowed to 11th in 2010,In addition to starting every game,Berry was on the field for almost half of Kansas City's special teams plays and was the only Chiefs defender to play every defensive snap.
He led the team in interceptions (4),and was second only to Derrick Johnson in tackles(92)and solo tackles(77)On December 26, 2010,Berry scored his first NFL touchdown on a 54-yard interception return against the Tennessee Titans.In his first playoff game, he recorded a career-high in solo tackles with 9 and passes defended with 4.          
On September 11, 2011,Berry suffered a torn ACL,and was placed on injured reserve on September 14, ending his season.Berry had surgery on September 29, 2011, and returned for the start of the 2012 NFL season.2014 season for Berry was a devastated moment for him.During a loss against the Oakland Raiders on November 20, 2014,Berry began to complain of chest pain.A mass was soon discovered in his chest, with him eventually being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma on December 8, 2014.Berry was placed on the Chiefs' non-football illness list,ending his season.Berry's doctor,Dr. Christopher Flowers,a lymphoma specialist at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta,said of Berry's diagnosis,"This is a diagnosis that is very treatable and potentially curable with standard chemotherapy approaches.The goal of Mr. Berry's treatment is to cure his lymphoma and we are beginning that treatment now."
On July 28, 2015,the Chiefs announced through their official Twitter account that Berry had been cleared to resume football activities after he was declared clear of cancer nearly nine months after his initial diagnosis.Berry returned to the field gradually,but earned back his starting job and had a phenomenal season.He was selected to another Pro Bowl as the starting safety and many experts and coaches around the league remarked that he was the best safety in the entire NFL.He was named Comeback Player of the Year,as he helped the Chiefs to an 11-5 record and Wild Card berth,after overcoming Hodgkin's Lymphoma.
