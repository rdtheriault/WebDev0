      <h2> Zlatan facts and why I choose him </h2>
     <li>Zlatan went to Malamo at a young age where other big clubs got intrest in him </li>
      <li> Multiple times voted best soccer player of the year for many legues </li>
    <li> Paris Saint Germain's all time top scorer:156</li>
    <li> He has played for great clubs like Malamo,Ajax,Juventus,Inter Milan, Barcalona, Milan Paris Saint Germain and
    Manchester United </li>
    <li> Has won 13 league tiltes in 15 seasons </li>
    <li>He had led Sweden to many wins and he is the capitain</li>
    <li>and he can break anckles</li>
    <li>Zlatan Ibrahimovic is also known for scoring one of the best goals while playing for sweden
      against england in a world cup qualifier<strong></li>
      <p>I choose Zlatan Ibrahimovic because he has played for lots of diffrent teams all over Europe and no matter where he went he scored goals
        ,lots of goals. Another reason is because he scores lots of overhead kicks and is realy good at doing skill moves. He is one of the best
        strikers to ever play soccer and he will become a legend when he retires.
