<td>The Impala was redesigned and had a "coke bottle" shape that similar to the 1963 Buick Riviera. Safety features were added that included a fully collapsible 
energy absorbing steering wheel column, side marker lights, and shoulder belts for hardtops, sedans, and wagons. The Impala was distinguished by bright lower 
body-side moldings, roof drip cap and reveal moldings on hardtops, bright side window accents on station wagons and sedans, deck lid center panel accents, and 
black accented taillight surrounds. Impala interiors were cloth, cloth and vinyl, or just all vinyl combinations. They came with full wheel covers as well.</td>

<td>I chose this vehical because it looks super awesome and is fun to drive. It also goes pretty fast and stands out.</td>
