It's so fascinating to see what kinds of monsters creators can come up with and if I can create something interesting and unique myself. With that being said, I started sketching models and ideas and came up with the Mediocris and Caudin. I actually hadn't even named the monsters before now so this was a nice push to do so. As for how I came up with the names, I simply put in defining characteristics into google translate and then transferred the words into latin. This produced some rather interesting names that not only sounded cool but also had a reason for being the waythey were.";

Nonetheless, it seems to have traces of legs so at some point it must've walked like a normal animal. Most of their tails seem to have a small ball on the end, possibly for a better grip on the land they move on. At first glance I had assumed that they were blind, which would explain the rather large ears, until I had gone to examine their antennae. The little balls on the tips of the antennae twitched away from my hand and when I had inspected them, I realized that they had a similar appearance to that of a bug's eye.

This discovery came after taking note that there were two differing types of the same species. One of them with a stronger tail, connecting both to their back and their bottom before splitting into two along with only one single antennae. This was the male. They weren't all that larger than their female counterparts, even being smaller in some cases, but they were much faster. I would assume this is because of the stronger tail.";

It's been days since I last saw the sunlight and I've spent every waking hour since I got to this goshforsaken lab spending my time trying to create the perfect creature. It hasn't gone well, however. The creatures are hostile, not to each other but to me. For very good reason though, of course. After all, I am the one that made them, pulled them apart and put them back together again in a way that would be deemed unnatural and immoral by many people. But I didn't have a choice, I HAD to do this. They would be great, amazing creatures that could aid us in our day to day life if only I could figure out what I was doing wrong!";

Or another one that shares a likeness with a fairy from some folklore or fairytale, only far less beautiful or fantastic. Or maybe you'd be more interested in my newest creation. I have decided not to name it as it isn't deserving of one. It's disgusting and may be the reason I drop this experiment altogether. It came out of the test tubes with no arms except for two tenticals that moved freely attached to its back. On the tips of the slimy tendrils were mouths resembling a venus fly-trap's, sharp jagged teeth included. Not to forget the singular eye, two ram horns and long, droopy ears at the back of its head. It's quite the sight and not a pleasant one. ";

You'd think I would simply be able to terminate the wretched abomination but apparently it's not nearly that simple and forgiving. Maybe this is life's way of punishing me but one of the containers has broken open. That thing is loose and I think we both know what it's going to do soon. The fact that I'm still alive is a miracle but I don't know how much longer that luxury will last. I'm writing this so that if anyone somehow manages to find this place that maybe, just maybe, they'll be able to kill this creature or, even better, continue my work after understanding what I was trying to do.
